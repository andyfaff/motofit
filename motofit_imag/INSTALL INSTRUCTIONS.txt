To install Motofit follow these instructions.	
1) Please update to the latest IGOR version.  (if you have the demo version, please download the most recent release).
2) Remove any previous installation of Motofit.If you want to keep the previous version, and if you install Motofit using the following procedures, then all you will need to do is remove the shortcut in the "IGOR procedures" folder.
3) Put the "Motofit" folder into the IGOR Pro folder (rename it if you want to).
4) Create a shortcut to that folder and place it in the "IGOR PROCEDURES" folder.  This action means that the reflectivity macros will initialise when you start IGOR up.
5) Place the example datasets wherever you would like to access them.

6) To install the Abeles XOP (optional), please place the platform dependent Abeles.xop and the Abeles help.ihf files in the Motofit directory. You should then create a shortcut (or alias) to the Abeles.xop file and place the shortcut in the \Igor Pro Folder\Igor Extensions\ folder.



NOTE:  There is a bug in the Globalfit2.ipf procedure from Wavemetrics, at least in V5.04B6.  In order to get the program to work properly you can a) ask Wavemetrics for an updated version of this procedure file OR b) email anz@ansto.gov.au for the version that Wavemetrics sent me.  The program may not compile, unless you have a copy of this procedure.
