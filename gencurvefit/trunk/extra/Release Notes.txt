070607 First release of GenCurvefit . Been through code with toothcomb, things look ok. Not crashed once. Can't see any memleaks. 

070607 Not an auspicious start, had to rename the entire XOP because of another program on the web.

070620 
added Waverange argument to XOP, so that one can use a subrange of measured data in the fit.
added ability to produce fit residuals
added extra minimisation costfunction (sum of absolute deviations) to pre-existing chi2.
fit is now automatically appended to the top graph if the data is displayed there.

070621
changed stopping condition.  Fit now stops if the standard deviations of the chi2 values of populations, divided by the mean, is less than the stopping tolerance.

070629
operation can now handle NaN/INF in the supplied ywave, it acts as if the points are masked. Before this an error was automatically generated.  An error is still generated if the /X=xwave contains NaN.
multivariate curvefitting added, both all-at-once and normal fitfunctions.  Up to 50 independent variables can be used.
added a window to show current progress of fit

070913
First Mac Unversal Binary.  Win32 and Mac versions are on same branch now.  Mac and Window versions have dialogue windows showing current status of fit.
