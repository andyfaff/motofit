Motofit installation instructions
=================================

The Motofit package uses two different types of files. The first are 'procedure
files', which are given the '.ipf' extension. The second are plugins, hereafter
called 'XOP's, which are compiled C modules. The procedure files and XOP's must
be put in the correct place for Motofit to work. This installation procedure
will outline how to put the files in the correct place.  If you have questions
then don't hesitate to get in contact with the package maintainer, Andrew
Nelson, via the "motofit" github page (email not listed for protection against
spambots). All queries are welcome (provided you've read these instructions).


Understanding how Igor loads user packages
------------------------------------------
To learn about how Igor loads XOP's and procedure files you can type in:

    displayhelptopic "Activating Extensions"
    displayhelptopic "Igor Pro User Files"

from the Igor commandline.


Installation Steps
------------------
(1) Locate the "Igor Pro User Files" directory.
    You can locate this directory by using:

    print SpecialDirPath("Igor Pro User Files", 0, 0, 0)

    from the command line. On OSX this path is typically:

    "Macintosh HD:Users:<username>:Documents:WaveMetrics:Igor Pro 7 User Files:"

    On Windows 7 this path is:

    "C:Users:<username>:Documents:WaveMetrics:Igor Pro 7 User Files:"

    Your exact location may differ slightly.


(2) Install the XOP's first.
    Below the "Igor Pro User Files" directory there is a directory called "Igor
    Extensions (64-bit)". Transfer the contents of the "Igor Extensions (64-bit)
    directory" contained in the Motofit installation archive to this directory
    (don't move the entire directory). If there are pre-existing files with the
    *same name* then please delete or move them elsewhere first. When Igor
    starts up it automatically loads all XOP's contained in the "Igor
    Extensions" directories.

(3) Install the User Procedures.
    Below the "Igor Pro User Files" directory there is a directory called "User
    Procedures". Transfer the motofit directory contained in the "User
    Procedures" directory in the installation archive to this directory. Again,
    if there is a pre-existing motofit directory then please delete or move
    elsewhere first. When Igor starts up it automatically allows these
    procedures to be loaded at a later stage.

(4) Install the Igor Procedures.
    The procedures installed in step 3 are not automatically loaded when Igor
    starts up. To allow them to load we place another procedure in the "Igor
    Procedures" directory below the "Igor Pro User Files" directory. Move the
    contents of the "Igor Procedures" directory in the installation archive to
    this directory.

(5) Start up Igor to test if everything works. There should now be a "Motofit"
    menu item available. Select "Motofit --> Load Motofit package". Once the
    loading has finished select the "Motofit --> Fit Reflectivity data" menu
    item.
